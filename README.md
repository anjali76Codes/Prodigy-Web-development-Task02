This Stopwatch Application is developed as part of Prodigy Infotech Task 2. The application allows users to measure time with precision, featuring essential functionalities such as starting, pausing, resetting, and recording lap times.

#HTML Structure:
The HTML structure includes elements such as h1 for the title, a .container div for the main timer display, a .timer div for displaying the timer, a .btn div for buttons, and an #laps-container div for displaying lap times.
#CSS Styling:
Various CSS rules define the styling for elements such as setting box-sizing, removing default margins and paddings, styling the body background, styling the timer container, button styles, and responsive design for smaller screens using media queries.
#JavaScript Functionality:
JavaScript functions handle the start, pause, stop, and reset functionality of the timer.
There are functions to update the timer display, format time values, handle laps, create lap items, clear laps, and update button labels.
